# Shimboot guide
A simple guide on shimboot, Linux on chromebooks.

### prerequisites:<br>
- A usb drive with around 32gbs (or more)
  - usb drive info
    - its recommended to check the model of your device. If you have a usb c port make use of the faster speeds.

    - For example, a e300 2nd gen has two usb 3.0 ports. So I bought a usb 3.1 128gb drive.
      <details>
      <summary>What happens if I use a usb 3.1 drive with a usb 3 port?</summary>
      <br>
      Nothing! You'll just be limited to usb 3 speeds. Its fine.
